A discrete event **S**imulator for **peer**-to-peer network modeling. **Speer is made for students, researchers and hobbyists.** It's goal is to allow
them to easily implement, simulate and study peer to peer networks.

It combines event-driven simulations with cycle-based concepts and allows parallelization by taking advantage of Goâ€™s concurrency features.

## Quickstart

After getting **Golang >= 1.6** and setting **$GOPATH**, install Speer via:
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srene/Speer/master/install.sh | bash
```

Now, you can run a simulation from a JSON configuration as follows:
```
speer -config=[path_to_configuration]
```

The see the options provided by `speer.go` run:
```
speer -h
```

You can run the default example in `examples/broadcast.go` via the command:
```
speer
```
